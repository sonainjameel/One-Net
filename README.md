# :sparkles: One-Net 

Welcome to the repository of our cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed specifically for advanced image white-balancing, a crucial step in achieving illumination-invariant imagery.

## :star2: Highlights 

- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Sets new benchmarks on the Cube+, NUS-8, and Intel-TAU datasets.
- **Efficiency Redefined:** With less than 22,000 parameters, suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Simplicity Meets Power:** Five convolutional layers with (1,1) kernel sizes demonstrate that complexity is not a prerequisite for excellence.
